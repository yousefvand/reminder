# Reminder

This is a work in progress aimed at using _systemd timers_ to remind events on desktop Linux using notification.
The Jalali part won't work as it was a design mistake. Instead

## How to use

Save your events in a **csv** file like the template at project root and run the program while `events.csv` is at the same directory as the program.

If any change happens edit the **csv** file and do the above step. Program will remove all previous events and import new ones from **csv** file.
